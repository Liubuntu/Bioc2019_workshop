Description: In this workshop, we will learn the existing R /
    Bioconductor lazy infrastructures, as well as the development of
    new interfaces. We will also show some examples in representation
    and comprehension of very big dataset from DNA/RNA-seq data. The
    workshop will be mainly instructor-led live demo with completely
    working examples. Instructions and notes will be available in the
    vignette.
